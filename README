This allows you to select some text using Vim's visual mode and then hit *
and # to search for it elsewhere in the file.  For example, hit V, select
a strange sequence of characters like "$! $!", and hit star.  You'll find
all other runs of "$! $!" in the file.

Vim's default behavior is to just extend the visual selection to the next
word that matches the word under the cursor.  Doesn't seem very useful.

TODO: just ran across http://github.com/thinca/vim-visualstar
Looks like it uses a lot more code to do pretty much the same thing.
Is it better?
